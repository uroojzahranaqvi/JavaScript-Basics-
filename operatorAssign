// Problem 1: Write a JavaScript program to perform arithmetic operations on two numbers (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

let firstNumber = parseFloat(prompt(`Enter the first number`));
let secondNumber = parseFloat(prompt(`Enter the second number`));
let addition = firstNumber + secondNumber;
let subtraction = firstNumber - secondNumber;
let multiplication = firstNumber * secondNumber;
let division = firstNumber / secondNumber;


console.log(`The addition of first number and second number is : ${addition} `);
console.log(`The subtraction of first number and second number is : ${subtraction} `);
console.log(`The multiplication of first number and second number is : ${multiplication} `);
console.log(`The division of first number and second number is : ${division} `);
